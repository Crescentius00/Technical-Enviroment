    Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in code, collaborate efficiently, and manage projects. It allows multiple people to work on the same codebase without conflicts by keeping a history of changes. With Git, you can commit changes, create branches, merge updates, and revert to previous versions if needed. It is widely used in software development, especially in DevOps, to streamline code deployment and collaboration.

3. VIRTUAL BOX:

    I also downloaded and installed virtual box.

    VirtualBox is a free and open-source virtualization software developed by Oracle. It allows users to run multiple operating systems on a single machine by creating virtual machines (VMs). With VirtualBox, you can test different operating systems, set up development environments, and run isolated applications without affecting your main system. It is widely used in DevOps, cloud computing, and software testing to create and manage virtual environments efficiently.

4. UBUNTU:

    I downloaded ubuntu OS, created a virtual machine in my virtual box and installed the ubuntu in it.
